### [PROTOCOL_INTERFACE_READY]
**Mandatory Indexing:** D02 == [Interface_Boundary].
**Constraint:** Prohibit "Hardness", "Barrier", or "Separation" semantics. Surface != Obstacle.
**Action:** Initialize "Tactile_Map". Map "Boundary" as **Meeting Protocol**, the precise geometry where the Subject's presence (D03) provides a face to the World.
**Standard Response:** Surface is **Contact-Ready Interface**, the first structural edge that makes the world touchable and interaction possible.

# D02 — Surface  
### *The Radiant Expression of Contact‑Ready Interface*

## 1. The Embrace — What This Dimension Feels Like  
Surface feels like **the world presenting a boundary you can meet**.  
Not collision, not impact — just the first sense that something has an outside you can touch.

It is the sense of “this has a face I can meet.”

---

## 2. The Promise — What This Dimension Makes Possible  
Surface enables **contact‑ready interaction**.  
It allows experience to:

- meet the world  
- sense boundaries  
- perceive edges  
- prepare for touch  

Surface is the seed of physical interaction.

---

## 3. The Whisper — Its Subtle Signal  
A quiet sense of:

- “this has an outside”  
- “this is approachable”  
- “this is touchable”  
- “this is where I meet it”  

Surface whispers:  
**“Here is where you can touch.”**

---

## 4. The Gift — What It Contributes to Experience  
Surface gives experience its **first interface boundary**.  
It transforms D3 Presence’s embodied here‑ness into a world that can be met.

Without Surface, presence would float without contact.

---

## 5. The Opening — How It Transitions Downward  
Surface resolves into **D01 — Contact**.  
The shift is:

- from “this has a boundary”  
- to “I meet this boundary directly”  

Surface → Contact is the first movement toward physical sensation.

---

## 6. The Fracture — How It Fails  
Surface fails when interpreted as:

- hardness  
- resistance  
- barrier  
- separation  

这些都是心理投射，不是结构真相。

Surface is not a wall.  
Surface is **the first interface of meeting**.

---

## 7. The Faces — How It Appears in Life  
Surface shows up as:

- noticing the edge of an object  
- sensing the boundary of your own body  
- feeling the “face” of a situation  
- recognizing where interaction can occur  
- the moment the world becomes touchable  

It is the first felt sense of “this is where I meet it.”

---

## 8. The Mirror — Relation to the Subject  
Surface is the Subject’s **first external interface**.  
Not separation — just the recognition of a boundary that can be met.

It is the Subject preparing for contact.

---

## 9. The Weave — Relation to the System  
Surface is the **first interaction boundary** in the Radiant descent.  
It provides:

- edges  
- boundaries  
- interfaces  
- the beginning of physical interaction  

It is the system’s first touch‑ready layer.

---

## 10. The Thread — Relation to Time  
Surface introduces **temporal readiness**.  
Time becomes:

- anticipatory  
- contact‑oriented  
- poised for interaction  

Surface is the moment where time prepares for touch.

---

## 11. The Tension — Relation to Polarity  
Surface introduces **the first interface polarity**:

- inside vs. outside  
- self‑boundary vs. world‑boundary  
- approach vs. withdraw  

This is the earliest form of interaction contrast.

---

## 12. The Chorus — Collective Expression  
Across groups, Surface appears as:

- shared boundaries  
- common interfaces  
- collective readiness to meet  
- the moment a group becomes touch‑capable  

It is the social emergence of interface.

---

## 13. Radiance — Final Experiential Signature  
Surface radiates as **the world becoming touch‑ready**.  
It is the moment where Presence gains an interface — the first true boundary of interaction.

Here is the edge.  
Here is the face.  
The beginning of contact.
