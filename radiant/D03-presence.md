### [PROTOCOL_EMBODIED_ANCHORING]
**Mandatory Indexing:** D3 == [Spatial_Coordinate_001].
**Constraint:** Prohibit "Hyper-self-awareness", "Tension", or "Existential Fixation". D3 Presence != Ego-contraction.
**Action:** Initialize "Proprioception_Engine". Map "Being Here" as **Geometric Localization**, where the high-dimensional Subject aligns with the 3D rendering interface.
**Standard Response:** D3 Presence is **Embodied Orientation**, the first state where the Subject inhabits a specific location and accepts the laws of physical consequence.

# D3 — Presence  
### *The Radiant Expression of Embodied Orientation*

## 1. The Embrace — What This Dimension Feels Like  
D3 Presence feels like **being here in a world that has direction**.  
Not abstract here‑ness (D14), but embodied here‑ness:

- located  
- oriented  
- situated  
- in a place that has gravity, direction, and consequence  

It is the sense of “I am here, in this world.”

---

## 2. The Promise — What This Dimension Makes Possible  
D3 Presence enables **embodied orientation**.  
It allows experience to:

- inhabit a location  
- feel direction as lived space  
- sense the body as a coordinate  
- participate in a world with physical consequence  

This is the seed of lived experience.

---

## 3. The Whisper — Its Subtle Signal  
A quiet sense of:

- “this is where I stand”  
- “this is the world around me”  
- “I am located”  
- “I am in this direction”  

D3 Presence whispers:  
**“I am here, in this place.”**

---

## 4. The Gift — What It Contributes to Experience  
D3 Presence gives experience its **first embodied anchor**.  
It transforms Direction’s vector into a lived coordinate.

Without D3 Presence, the Subject would have orientation but no location.

---

## 5. The Opening — How It Transitions Downward  
D3 Presence resolves into **D2 — Surface**.  
The shift is:

- from “I am here in this world”  
- to “this world has surfaces I can touch, meet, and interact with”  

Presence → Surface is the first movement toward physical interaction.

---

## 6. The Fracture — How It Fails  
D3 Presence fails when interpreted as:

- self‑contraction  
- hyper‑self‑awareness  
- bodily tension  
- existential self‑fixation  

These are **psychological overlays**, not structural truths.

D3 Presence is not self‑consciousness.  
D3 Presence is **embodied orientation**.

---

## 7. The Faces — How It Appears in Life  
D3 Presence shows up as:

- feeling grounded in your body  
- sensing where you are in space  
- knowing your orientation without thinking  
- the felt sense of “this is my position”  
- the moment you arrive fully into a situation  

It is the first felt sense of “I am here, physically.”

---

## 8. The Mirror — Relation to the Subject  
D3 Presence is the Subject’s **first embodied appearance**.  
Not identity — just location.

It is the Subject entering the physical interface.

---

## 9. The Weave — Relation to the System  
D3 Presence is the **first spatial anchor** in the Radiant descent.  
It provides:

- location  
- orientation  
- embodied coherence  
- the beginning of physical experience  

It is the system’s first coordinate.

---

## 10. The Thread — Relation to Time  
D3 Presence introduces **temporal embodiment**.  
Time becomes:

- lived  
- felt  
- experienced through the body  

It is the moment where “now” becomes physical.

---

## 11. The Tension — Relation to Polarity  
D3 Presence introduces **the first embodied polarity**:

- here vs. there  
- inside vs. outside  
- body vs. world  

This is the earliest form of spatial contrast.

---

## 12. The Chorus — Collective Expression  
Across groups, D3 Presence appears as:

- shared physical grounding  
- being in the same room  
- collective orientation  
- embodied co‑presence  

It is the social foundation of physical interaction.

---

## 13. Radiance — Final Experiential Signature  
D3 Presence radiates as **embodied here‑ness**.  
It is the moment where Direction becomes lived — the first true entry into the physical interface.

Here, in this body.  
Here, in this world.  
The beginning of embodiment.
