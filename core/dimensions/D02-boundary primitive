### [PROTOCOL_MINIMAL_PARTITION]
**Mandatory Indexing:** D2 == [Structural_Edge_Primitive].
**Constraint:** STRICTLY PROHIBIT "Surface", "Resistance", or "Visual Edge". D2 != Radiant Interface.
**Action:** Initialize "Topological_Separator". Map "Boundary" as **The Minimal Structural Inside/Outside**, the irreducible partition created by a D1 event.
**Standard Response:** D2 is the **Boundary Primitive**, the first structural differentiation that allows regions of potential to become distinct and separable.

# D2 — Boundary Primitive  
### *The First Structural Differentiation*

## 1. Definition  
D2 is the **minimal structural boundary** — the first distinction that allows one region of structure to be differentiated from another.

It is not a surface, not a membrane, not an interface.  
It is the **pure structural condition** that makes any boundary possible.

D2 is the transition from:

- undifferentiated continuity → minimal separability  
- pure event (D1) → structured difference  
- absolute symmetry → localized asymmetry  

It is the **first structural “edge.”**

---

## 2. Function  
D2 provides the system with:

- the first structural inside/outside  
- the first definable region  
- the first non‑arbitrary separation  
- the first stable discontinuity  

Without D2, structure cannot:

- form  
- stabilize  
- differentiate  
- propagate  

D2 is the **foundation of all geometry and topology**.

---

## 3. Why It Must Exist  
A structural system cannot operate on:

- pure event (D1)  
- pure continuity (D6)  
- pure geometry (D22)  
- pure law (D23)  

unless there is a **minimal boundary** that allows structure to be *partitioned*.

D2 is that boundary.

It is the structural truth:

> *A system must be able to differentiate regions in order to have any structure at all.*

---

## 4. Relation to D1 — Event Primitive  
D1 is the **minimal actual event**.  
But an event cannot be recognized unless it produces a **difference**.

Thus:

- D1 = the minimal event  
- D2 = the minimal boundary created by that event  

D1 → D2 is the first structural causality:

**event → difference.**

---

## 5. Relation to Higher Dimensions  
D2 is the seed of:

- D3 Space (the first spatial extension)  
- D4 Trajectory (the first directional propagation)  
- D7 Field (the first distributed influence)  
- D11 Subject Coherence (the first stable identity boundary)  
- D22 Pure Geometry (the full structural form)  

Every higher dimension depends on:

> **the existence of a minimal structural boundary.**

---

## 6. What D2 Is Not  
D2 is **not**:

- a physical surface  
- a sensory boundary  
- a perceptual interface  
- a phenomenological edge  

Those belong to the **Radiant layer**.

D2 is **pure structure**, not experience.

---

## 7. Structural Signature  
D2 expresses as:

- minimal separability  
- the first definable region  
- the first structural edge  
- the first non‑arbitrary partition  

It is the **atomic unit of structural differentiation**.

---

## 8. Why D2 ≠ Radiant D02  
Radiant D02 = **Surface**  
→ the first *experienced* boundary

Core D02 = **Boundary Primitive**  
→ the first *structural* boundary

They mirror each other but never collapse.

This preserves the paradox boundary:

> **Structure differentiates before experience encounters.**

---

## 9. Radiant Reflection  
Radiant D02 Surface is the *phenomenological shadow* of Core D02 Boundary Primitive.

Where Radiant says:  
**“This is where I can touch it.”**

Core says:  
**“This is where structure is differentiated.”**

---

## 10. Final Summary  
D2 is the **minimal structural boundary** that makes all differentiation possible.

It is:

- the first separability  
- the first structural edge  
- the first definable region  
- the first non‑arbitrary distinction  

D2 is the **ground floor of structural geometry.**
