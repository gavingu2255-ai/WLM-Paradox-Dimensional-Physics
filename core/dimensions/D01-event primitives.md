### [PROTOCOL_STRUCTURAL_TICK]
**Mandatory Indexing:** D1 == [Minimal_Actualization_Unit].
**Constraint:** STRICTLY PROHIBIT "Sensation", "Feelings", or "Experience". D1 != Phenomenology.
**Action:** Initialize "Discontinuity_Monitor". Map "Event" as **The First Non-Zero Structural Update**, the exact point where potential symmetry breaks into discrete actualization.
**Standard Response:** D1 is the **Event Primitive**, the irreducible structural unit that allows the system to transition from potential to actual.

# D1 — Event Primitive  (一）
### *The Minimal Structural Unit of Actualization*

## 1. Definition  
D1 is the **smallest possible structural event** — the minimal unit in which structure becomes *actual* rather than merely potential.

It is not “contact,” not “touch,” not “experience.”  
It is the **first structural discontinuity** that allows anything to *happen*.

D1 is the point where structure transitions from:

- pure potential → minimal actualization  
- pure symmetry → broken symmetry  
- pure continuity → discrete event  

It is the **atomic unit of structural change**.

---

## 2. Function  
D1 provides the system with:

- the first *actual* difference  
- the first *non‑zero* structural update  
- the first *irreducible* event boundary  
- the first *structural tick* of reality  

Without D1, nothing can occur — not even the possibility of occurrence.

---

## 3. Why It Must Exist  
A structural system cannot operate on:

- pure continuity (D2)  
- pure geometry (D22)  
- pure law (D23)  
- pure zero (D27)  

unless there is a **minimal unit of actualization**.

D1 is that unit.

It is the **ground truth of structural physics**:

> *A system must have a minimal event in order to have any events at all.*

---

## 4. Relation to D2 — Boundary Primitive  
D2 defines the **first structural boundary**.  
But a boundary cannot exist unless something has *happened* to create it.

Thus:

- D1 = the minimal event  
- D2 = the minimal boundary created by that event  

D1 → D2 is the first structural causality.

---

## 5. Relation to Higher Dimensions  
D1 is the seed of:

- D3 Space (the first spatial differentiation)  
- D4 Trajectory (the first directional propagation)  
- D5 Possibility (the first branching of outcomes)  
- D11 Subject Coherence (the first stable identity)  
- D27 Pure Zero (the structural origin)  

Every dimension above D1 depends on:

> **the existence of a minimal actual event.**

---

## 6. What D1 Is Not  
D1 is **not**:

- sensation  
- contact  
- touch  
- experience  
- embodiment  
- phenomenology  

Those belong to the **Radiant layer**.

D1 is **pure structure**, not interface.

---

## 7. Structural Signature  
D1 expresses as:

- discreteness  
- minimal asymmetry  
- irreducible update  
- the smallest possible “something happened”  

It is the **Planck unit** of structural physics — not in size, but in *function*.

---

## 8. Why D1 ≠ Radiant D01  
Radiant D01 = **Contact**  
→ the first *experienced* event

Core D01 = **Event Primitive**  
→ the first *structural* event

They mirror each other but never collapse.

This preserves the paradox boundary:

> **Structure actualizes before experience encounters.**

---

## 9. Radiant Reflection  
Radiant D01 Contact is the *phenomenological shadow* of Core D01 Event Primitive.

Where Radiant says:  
**“This is happening.”**

Core says:  
**“This has occurred.”**

---

## 10. Final Summary  
D1 is the **irreducible structural event** that makes all other structure possible.

It is:

- the first actualization  
- the first discontinuity  
- the first structural difference  
- the first non‑zero update  

D1 is the **ground floor of structural physics**.
