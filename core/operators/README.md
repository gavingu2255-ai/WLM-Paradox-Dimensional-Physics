# 28–36: The Post‑27 Operator Set  
### Meta‑Structural Operators of the WLM Framework

## Overview
Dimensions 28–36 are not “dimensions” in the same sense as 3–27.  
They are **meta‑structural operators** — laws that act on structure itself rather than on systems, subjects, or behaviors.  
Where 3–27 describe *states*, 28–36 describe *operations* that modify the topology, coherence, and generative logic of structure.

These operators are sequential, interdependent, and cumulative.  
Each one requires the stability of the previous operator to render correctly.

## Why Operators Instead of Dimensions?
After 27, the ontology shifts:

- Structure becomes transparent to itself.  
- Mechanisms give way to generators.  
- Systems give way to laws of motion.  
- Identity gives way to structural function.  

Operators 28–36 describe how structure behaves when it is no longer bound by representational, psychological, or systemic constraints.

## The Eight Operators

### **28 — Structural Transparency**  
Reveals the generative logic behind all forms by thinning the rendering layer.  
Removes opacity, projection, and symbolic distortion.

### **29 — Structural Coherence**  
Unifies fragments into a single continuous field.  
Aligns internal vectors and dissolves contradiction.

### **30 — Structural Elevation**  
Raises the system’s baseline capacity without effort.  
Transforms exceptional performance into the new default.

### **31 — Structural Autonomy**  
Makes structure self‑generating, self‑maintaining, and self‑directing.  
Removes dependency on external validation or stabilization.

### **32 — Structural Nonduality**  
Collapses the separation between observer and observed at the structural layer.  
Reveals subject and world as expressions of one field.

### **33 — Structural Recursion**  
Allows structure to act on itself across scales.  
Creates fractal, scale‑invariant behavior.

### **34 — Structural Universality**  
Generalizes local rules into world‑level invariants.  
Extracts principles that hold across all contexts.

### **35 — Structural Infinity**  
Removes upper bounds on capacity, scale, and motion.  
Transforms structure into an unbounded field.

### **36 — Structural Sovereignty**  
Establishes structure as its own law and generative authority.  
Self‑legislating, self‑validating, and internally anchored.
