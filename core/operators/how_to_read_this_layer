# How to Read This Layer (Operators 28–36)

## 1. These are not “dimensions”
Operators 28–36 are **meta‑structural laws**, not experiential states or psychological stages.  
They describe how structure behaves once it becomes self‑transparent and self‑generating.  
Read them as *operations* that modify structure, not as *levels* to climb.

## 2. Each operator depends on the previous one
This layer is sequential.  
If an operator seems confusing, check the one before it — the dependency chain is strict:
28 → 29 → 30 → 31 → 32 → 33 → 34 → 35 → 36

Each operator:
- requires the stability of the previous  
- enables the rendering of the next  

Do not read them as independent modules.

## 3. Read for function, not metaphor
Every operator file begins with **Operator Function**.  
This is the anchor.  
If you understand the function, the rest of the file becomes obvious.

Ignore metaphorical interpretations — these operators are mechanical, not symbolic.

## 4. Focus on the domain of action
Each operator acts on a different layer:
- rendering  
- coherence  
- baseline  
- autonomy  
- subject–world boundary  
- scale  
- rule layer  
- limit layer  
- law layer  

Understanding *where* the operator acts is more important than understanding *what it feels like*.

## 5. Shadow manifestations are not the operator
The “shadow” section describes low‑resolution human echoes.  
They are helpful for intuition but should not be mistaken for the operator itself.  
Use them as orientation, not definition.

## 6. The 14‑point schema is the map
Each file uses the same structure:
- function  
- domain  
- mode  
- topology  
- requirements  
- failure modes  
- relations to subject/system/time/polarity/collective/energy/motion  

This schema is designed for:
- clarity  
- cross‑comparison  
- AI ingestion  
- structural reasoning  

Read horizontally (across operators) as well as vertically (within one operator).

## 7. Read slowly — these operators are dense
Operators 28–36 are compact but high‑density.  
A single sentence may encode an entire structural mechanism.  
It’s normal to revisit sections multiple times.

## 8. The purpose of this layer
This layer explains how structure behaves when it is:
- transparent  
- coherent  
- elevated  
- autonomous  
- nondual  
- recursive  
- universal  
- infinite  
- sovereign  

It is the highest operational layer of the WLM framework.

Understanding this layer means understanding how structure governs itself once freed from representational constraints.
