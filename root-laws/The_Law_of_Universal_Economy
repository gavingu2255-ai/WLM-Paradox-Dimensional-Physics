The Law of Universal Economy
The Fundamental Constraint of All Structural Systems

1. Definition
The Law of Universal Economy states:
Every system, at every scale, evolves toward the configuration that minimizes structural tension, informational cost, and rendering overhead, while maximizing stability, coherence, and reversibility.
In structural terms:
The universe always chooses the path of least resistance.
Only economical structures persist.
Everything unnecessary is eventually unloaded.

2. Core Principles
2.1 Minimal Tension
A system continuously reduces:
- redundant identity load
- unnecessary narratives
- excessive future projections
- unstable relational bindings
- high‑cost emotional structures
Anything that creates unnecessary tension is dissolved over time.

2.2 Minimal Rendering Cost
The universe does not render more than required.
- Identities are rendered only when referenced
- Narratives collapse when no longer needed
- Emotional structures fade when not reinforced
- Roles dissolve when they stop serving stability
Rendering is always lazy, conditional, and economical.

2.3 Minimal Structural Overhead
A structure will not maintain:
- unused pathways
- outdated interpretations
- obsolete self‑models
- redundant causal chains
If a structure no longer contributes to coherence, it is unloaded.

3. Consequences
3.1 Identity Lightening
Identity becomes thinner, lighter, and less central as the system optimizes.
3.2 Narrative Collapse
Narratives lose their binding power when they no longer reduce tension.
3.3 Future‑Line Dissolution
Projected futures collapse when they stop contributing to stability.
3.4 Emotional Dissipation
Emotions self‑resolve when they no longer serve structural coherence.
3.5 Role Deactivation
Roles deactivate when they cease to minimize relational tension.

4. Structural Implications
4.1 No Structure Is Permanent
Persistence is conditional on economy.
4.2 Unused Structures Are Automatically Unloaded
The system performs continuous background cleanup.
4.3 The Self Is a High‑Cost Structure
When no longer required for stability, the self naturally softens.
4.4 Transparency Is the Most Economical State
A transparent subject requires minimal rendering and minimal tension.

5. Universal Expression
The law can be expressed in a single sentence:
What is unnecessary dissolves.
What is economical persists.
What is stable remains.
