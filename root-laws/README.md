# **WLM Root Laws**
### *The Foundational Axioms of the World-Line Mechanics Framework*

The **root-laws** directory contains the foundational axioms that define the generative behavior of all structures within the WLM framework.  
These laws are not hypotheses or theories — they are **structural starting points** from which the entire system emerges.

---

## **Included Root Laws**

### **1. Axioms-Do-Not-Need-Verification.md**
Axioms are validated by coherence, generativity, and reproducibility — not by external proof.  
This document defines why the WLM framework begins with axioms and how they function.

---

### **2. The-Law-of-Universal-Economy.md**
**Economy = Unloading.**  
The universe minimizes unnecessary tension, rendering cost, and structural overhead.  
What is unnecessary dissolves; only economical structures persist.

---

### **3. The-Law-of-Universal-Holding.md**
**Holding = Love = Structural Capacity.**  
The universe preserves necessary structure by sustaining paradox, coherence, and emergence.  
What is held can grow; what is unsupported collapses.

---

## **Purpose of the Root Layer**
Together, these documents form the **axiom layer** of WLM:

- Economy removes what cannot be supported  
- Holding supports what cannot be removed  
- Axioms define the rules of generative structure  

This triad establishes the foundation for all higher‑level dimensional behavior.

## Teaching Materials Policy

The WLM framework is open, transparent, and freely accessible at the structural level.  
All **root laws**, **dimensional mechanics**, and **generative principles** are published without restriction.

However, **teaching materials** — including tutorials, explanatory documents, guided examples, and pedagogical content — belong to the **interface layer**, not the structural layer.

Therefore:

- Teaching materials are **not automatically provided**  
- Teaching materials require **explicit commissioning**  
- Teaching materials are **paid work**  
- Without commissioning, readers are expected to derive their own understanding from the root laws

In short:

**If teaching is required, it must be requested and compensated.  
Otherwise, readers are responsible for their own interpretation.**
