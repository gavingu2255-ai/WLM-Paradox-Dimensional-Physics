# **WLM Root Laws**
### *The Foundational Axioms of the World-Line Mechanics Framework*

The **root-laws** directory contains the foundational axioms that define the generative behavior of all structures within the WLM framework.  
These laws are not hypotheses or theories — they are **structural starting points** from which the entire system emerges.

## **Included Root Laws**

### **1. Axioms-Do-Not-Need-Verification.md**
Axioms are validated by coherence, generativity, and reproducibility — not by external proof.  
This document defines why the WLM framework begins with axioms and how they function.

---

### **2. The-Law-of-Universal-Economy.md**
**Economy = Unloading.**  
The universe minimizes unnecessary tension, rendering cost, and structural overhead.  
What is unnecessary dissolves; only economical structures persist.

---

### **3. The-Law-of-Universal-Holding.md**
**Holding = Love = Structural Capacity.**  
The universe preserves necessary structure by sustaining paradox, coherence, and emergence.  
What is held can grow; what is unsupported collapses.

---

## **Purpose of the Root Layer**
Together, these documents form the **axiom layer** of WLM:

- Economy removes what cannot be supported  
- Holding supports what cannot be removed  
- Axioms define the rules of generative structure  

This triad establishes the foundation for all higher‑level dimensional behavior.
