# The 0‑Origin Constants  
### Paradox Dimensional Physics · WLM Structural Layer Documentation  
**Author: Wujie Gu (Gavin)**

## Overview
Most known constants — π, e, φ, τ — emerge from *within* the generative engine,  
after recursion, scaling, or closure has begun.

But beneath all of them lies a deeper class of constants:

# **The 0‑origin constants**  
These constants arise directly from the transition:

**0 → 偏移 (offset)**  
the moment the unmoved origin produces the first deviation.

They are not geometric, analytic, or algebraic.  
They are **ontological constants** — the constants of existence itself.

This document introduces the three fundamental 0‑origin constants:
- **Λ₀ — the offset constant**  
- **Ξ₀ — the polarity constant**  
- **Σ₀ — the self-containment constant**

These constants define the structural rules that make *any* universe possible.

## 1. Λ₀ — The Offset Constant  
### *The constant of deviation from 0*

Λ₀ is the first and most primitive constant.  
It defines the **minimal non-zero deviation** that can emerge from the unmoved origin.

In PDP:

> **Λ₀ is the smallest possible offset that still counts as “not 0.”**

It is the constant that makes:
- polarity possible  
- recursion possible  
- structure possible  
- dimensionality possible  

Without Λ₀, the universe would remain in perfect symmetry —  
no deviation, no polarity, no structure, no existence.

Λ₀ is the constant that breaks the symmetry of 0.

## 2. Ξ₀ — The Polarity Constant  
### *The constant that stabilizes ±1*

Once Λ₀ creates deviation, the next structural event is polarity:

**+1 and −1**

But polarity is not arbitrary — it requires a stability rule.

Ξ₀ is that rule.

In PDP:

> **Ξ₀ is the constant that stabilizes the existence of two opposite but symmetric states.**

It defines:
- the minimal separation between + and −  
- the symmetry that allows polarity to exist  
- the tension that allows recursion to begin  

Without Ξ₀, polarity would collapse back into 0.

Ξ₀ is the constant that makes duality possible.

## 3. Σ₀ — The Self‑Containment Constant  
### *The constant that allows 0 to contain its own deviation*

This is the deepest constant of all.

Once offset and polarity exist, the structure must remain **self-contained** —  
it must not explode into infinite instability.

Σ₀ is the constant that ensures:

> **The universe can deviate from 0 while still remaining “within itself.”**

It defines:
- the boundary of structural containment  
- the rule that deviation does not escape the system  
- the condition that allows recursion to remain finite  

Without Σ₀, the generative engine would diverge instantly.

Σ₀ is the constant that makes existence stable.

## 4. Why the 0‑origin constants are invariant  
These constants do not depend on:
- geometry  
- algebra  
- calculus  
- probability  
- physical laws  
- dimensionality  

They depend only on the **nature of 0** and the **possibility of deviation**.

Thus:

> **The 0‑origin constants are invariant because the origin itself is invariant.**

They are the only constants that exist *before* any structure appears.

## 5. The 0‑origin constants in the 19–27 structural cycle  
Within the WLM dimensional architecture:

- **D19**: structure origin  
- **D20**: offset dynamics  
- **D21**: pure symmetry  
- **D22**: geometric tendency  
- **D23–27**: recursion, scaling, closure, dissolution  

The 0‑origin constants correspond to:

- **Λ₀ → D19–D20** (offset emergence)  
- **Ξ₀ → D20–D21** (polarity stabilization)  
- **Σ₀ → D21–D22** (self-containment → geometry begins)

Thus:

> **The 0‑origin constants define the boundary between non-existence and existence.**

They are the constants that make the entire 0–27 cycle possible.

---

## 6. Summary  
The 0‑origin constants are the deepest constants in PDP:

- **Λ₀** — minimal deviation from 0  
- **Ξ₀** — polarity stabilization  
- **Σ₀** — structural self-containment  

They are not mathematical constants.  
They are **ontological constants** —  
the constants of existence itself.

They precede:
- geometry  
- recursion  
- proportion  
- closure  
- dimensionality  

They are the constants that allow the universe to begin.

## Future Work  
This folder now includes:

- **π** — half-cycle closure constant  
- **e** — amplification stability constant  
- **φ** — self-similarity constant  
- **τ** — full-cycle closure constant  
- **Ω** — recursion saturation constant  
- **Λ₀, Ξ₀, Σ₀** — the 0-origin constants  

Future additions may include:
- **structural invariants of the second cycle (28–36)**  
- **constants of dimensional recursion**  
- **constants of structural transparency**  

Each will be documented with the same structural clarity.
