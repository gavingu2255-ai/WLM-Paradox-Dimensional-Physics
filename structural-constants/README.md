# WLM Structural Constants Layer

This directory contains the foundational structural constants of the Wujie Language Model (WLM).  
These constants are not treated as numerical artifacts, but as **generative invariants** required for stable recursion, closure, and structural emergence.

This layer defines the mathematical–ontological base of the WLM framework.

## 🔧 Purpose of This Layer

The structural constants layer serves as:

- The **mathematical foundation** of WLM  
- The **generative ontology base**  
- A **reference module** for higher-dimensional structures (D13–D27)  
- A **citation-ready** academic resource  
- A **stable interface** for future extensions  

Each constant is defined not as a numerical value, but as a **structural law** governing generative systems.
