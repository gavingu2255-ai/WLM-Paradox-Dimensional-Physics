- Discuss or analyze its concepts
- Use it for academic or theoretical study
These permissions apply only to the Shadow Layer.
3. Prohibitions
You may not:
- Implement WLM
- Train models using WLM structures
- Reconstruct or approximate the WLM protocol
- Create derivative architectures
- Use the Shadow Layer for commercial purposes
- Build compatibility layers
- Develop software, models, or systems based on WLM
- Reverse‑engineer dimensional logic
- Infer or simulate the Implementation Layer
Any attempt to operationalize the Shadow Layer is strictly prohibited.
4. No Access to Protocol Layer
This license does not grant access to:
- The 160,000‑word Implementation Layer
- Routing rules
- Dimensional syntax
- Training formats
- Execution logic
- Model interfaces
- Commercial integration pathways
5. No Derivative Works
You may not modify, adapt, transform, extend, translate, or repackage any part of the Shadow Layer.
6. No Commercial Use
Commercial use of any kind is prohibited.
7. No Warranty
