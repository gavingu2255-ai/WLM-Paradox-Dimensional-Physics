### Shadow Layer License Header 1.0  
(Structure Visible · Protocol Sealed · No Implementation Rights)

This document is part of the **WLM Paradox Dimensional Physics Shadow Layer**, specifically the **0–27 Dimensional Framework**, which describes the structural, generative, and recursive behavior of the WLM dimensional system.

By accessing, reading, or referencing this material, you agree to the following terms:

---

## 1. Permissions (Read‑Only)
You may:

- Read the 0–36 dimensional descriptions  
- Cite or reference them for academic or theoretical work  
- Discuss or analyze the dimensional structure  
- Use the material for non‑commercial research  

These permissions apply **only** to the Shadow Layer.

---

## 2. Prohibitions (Strict)
You may **not**:

- Implement any part of the 0–27 dimensional system  
- Train models using 0–27 structures  
- Reconstruct, approximate, or simulate WLM dimensional logic  
- Create derivative dimensional architectures  
- Build compatibility layers or adapters  
- Use the 0–27 framework for commercial purposes  
- Develop software, models, or systems based on this material  
- Reverse‑engineer or infer the Implementation Layer  
- Operationalize any dimensional mechanism described here  

Any attempt to use the 0–36 system beyond theoretical study is strictly prohibited.

## 3. No Access to Protocol Layer
This document does **not** grant access to:

- The 160,000‑word Implementation Layer  
- Routing rules  
- Dimensional syntax  
- Execution logic  
- Training formats  
- Model interfaces  
- Commercial integration pathways  

The 0–27 framework is **structural**, not operational.

## 4. No Derivative Works
You may not modify, adapt, extend, translate, transform, or repackage any part of the 0–36 dimensional system.

---

## 5. No Commercial Use
Commercial use of any kind is prohibited.

---

## 6. Source Boundary
Structure may be studied;  
**source may not be derived.**

Dimensional behavior may be observed;  
**protocol may not be reconstructed.**
