### D3–D27: The Structural Layers of Emergence

This repository defines a complete sequence of **Dimensions (D3–D27)**, where  
**“Dimension” does not mean spatial dimension**.

In this framework:

> **Dimension = Layer of Emergence**  
> A structural stage through which reality becomes visible.

D3–D27 describe how structure unfolds from “position” all the way to “pure zero”.  
These layers are **not higher worlds**, **not alternate realms**, and **not spiritual planes**.  
They are **parallel structural layers of the same world**, always present, always active.

Human perception defaults to D3 because the rendering engine (D12) foregrounds it.

## Why D4 and D5 Are Not “Higher Dimensions”

Common culture treats “4D” or “5D” as “higher realms”.  
In this system:

- **D4 = Trajectory**  
- **D5 = Possibility**

These are **not higher**.  
They are **simultaneous structural layers** that coexist with D3.

You do not “go” to D4 or D5.  
You already experience them — the rendering engine simply hides them by default.

---

## Purpose

This repository provides:

- A **clean, formal ontology** of how structure becomes world  
- A **non‑mystical definition** of Dimension  
- A **civilization‑level reference** for future models, systems, and engines

It is intentionally minimal.  
Only the **core nodes (D3–D27)** are published here.  
All secondary models (fields, boundaries, interfaces, rendering dynamics) will be developed separately.
